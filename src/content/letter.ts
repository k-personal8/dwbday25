  "It’s been almost two years now since I made the best decision of my life to spend my New Year’s Eve celebrations in Miami with you. I know we were just friends on your 18th Birthday, but I hope some part of your wishes included me in it. I know we were destined to be together forever because since that January 1st in 2024, you have been my first thought to start the new year. I actually fell asleep that day when the clock struck 12, but when the sounds of fireworks woke me up, I rushed to text you and ask about your night.",

  "I remember how much I cared about your trip to the Grand Canyon two years ago. You kept me so sane throughout the most stressful period of my life; I can only spend forever thanking you with my love. I remember we’d talk about how much we knew about each other as friends, and it got me thinking about what that number truly is now. I’d say without a shadow of a doubt that I know you better than you know yourself, but that’s only because I love to learn every detail about you, think about what you’re doing even when you’re not with me, and help do things for you behind the scenes that you might not even know about. I know that one day you will be the most successful doctor in the world, whether in Pediatric ENT or anything else, and that’s because you are so caring and kind towards other people. I want you to know that for the rest of my life, my job will be to take care of you and keep that gorgeous smile on your face :)",

  "Devanshi, you are truly the best thing to happen to me. I wish more than anything in the world to be with you right now. I want to celebrate the most special day of the year with the girl who is the reason why this world is so special.",

  "Much like museum curators, I struggled to figure out how to pick just a few items to include in our “Museum of Us” since every moment we’ve ever had together has meant more to me than anyone could ever know. Much like museum visitors, I often find myself in awe, thinking back to how incredible each moment was to us. Thank you for being the reason I will never finish filling this museum with masterpieces, and for being my reminder that there is still so much beauty in this world. For without you, there is no art, no music, and no joy that could ever feel the same.",

  "Happy Birthday, my love. Here's to many more years of adventures, lazy weekends, inside jokes, and more love for each other every day.",
